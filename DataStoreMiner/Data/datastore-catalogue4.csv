<p>The London Analysts Support site team (LASS) have developed this dataset in consultation with the Ambulance service to make their data more suitable for crime analysis purposes. Please note: The primary purpose of the London Ambulance Service is to save lives and respond effectively to medical emergencies. The data provided here is an extract of ambulance data which is recorded to monitor their performance to this end.</p>\
<p>The LASS team work with the ambulance service to extract data suitable for crime analysis professionals, with the aim of causing minimum disruption to frontline services.</p>\
<p>These incidents of assault injury have been identified through a fairly sophisticated search through various codes and descriptions of incidents that occur in the process of responding to a 999 call. This has been done in close consultation with the ambulance service to ensure that the data is fit for crime analysis purposes. It should be considered that the precision of the crime related information, in the above said process, is of secondary consideration to the need to record accurate medical information, therefore the accuracy of the data may have minor variations over time and in different areas of London. LASS work closely with the London Ambulance Service to ensure that there is no significant impact on the quality of information for crime related purposes.</p>\
<p>Crime analysts use this data to scan for issues, patterns and trends in general violent crime in London. They compare and contrast with traditional sources of intelligence such as recorded crime data from the police. Recently this data set has been used in the Mayor's meetings with the police to identify violent crime hotspots that were not previously recognised. There are ongoing improvements to improve the data collection process. We will be updating the metadata and providing more information in due course.

<p>The General Fertility Rate (GFR) is the number of live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44.</p>\
<p>The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the average number of live children that a group of women would bear if they experienced the age-specific fertility  rates of the calendar year in question throughout their childbearing lifespan.</p>\

This generally produces a better match of births to those at risk of having births. However, local authority level population estimates are only considered reliable in five-year age bands.

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>This release takes annual figures on net housing supply in England from two data sources:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>1) information submitted to Communities and Local Government (CLG) by local authorities in all regions except London through the Housing Flows Reconciliation (HFR) form; and </li>\
<li>2) information collected by the Greater London Authority (GLA) for London Boroughs. </li>\
</ul>\
<p>From 2000-01 to 2003-04, all local authorities submitted data to Communities and Local Government through the HFR form. Between 2004-05 and 2008-09, Communities and Local Government worked jointly with Regional Planning Bodies in some regions on joint returns to ensure consistency between the net housing supply figures reported at various geographical levels.</p>\
<p>In 2010 the abolition of Regional Planning Bodies prompted a return to submission through the HFR for all local authorities outside London. Because of the unique status of the GLA, London Boroughs continue to supply their data through the GLA. Users should note that the London figures are provisional at this stage and may be subject to change before they are reported in the GLA’s Annual Monitoring Report in February 2011. Local authorities have until early September, five months after the end of the financial year, to complete the HFR form.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>This change to the data collection process has enabled Communities and Local Government (CLG) to publish the net supply of housing statistical release for 2009-10 four months earlier than in previous years.</p>\
<p>CLG also publish house building statisitcs by local authority on their <a href=""http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/housebuilding/livetables/"">website</a>&nbsp;(Table 253), but the GLA prefer to use Net Additional Dwellings because they are more complete in terms of borough coverage, and comprehensive, as they&nbsp;cover more than just new build.<span style=""font-size: 9pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;"">&nbsp;</span></p>","Local Authority","Greater London","Department of Communities and Local Government","","","Annual","2004/05-2010/11","Oct 2011","05/12/2011","Crown Copyright","http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/netsupplyhousing/","","http://data.london.gov.uk/datafiles/housing/net-additional-dwellings-borough.xls","","","","","","","","Focus on London - Housing","clg, stock, supply","http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/focus-london-housing","",""

<p>The table shows total number of local government electors includes residential qualifiers and attainers, Peers and European Union citizens. Local government areas are unitary authorities, London boroughs and district councils in England; unitary authorities in Wales; council areas in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>\
<p>This table is derived from data supplied to ONS by Electoral Registration Officers and shows the number of people who on 1 December were registered to vote in the parliamentary and local elections in the UK. The residence qualification requires a person to be normally living at the address on the qualifying date, even if temporarily absent. People having more than one place of residence, such as students, may therefore be included on more than one register.</p>\
<p>In Northern Ireland, eligibility for registration requires three month's residence within the province. Overseas electors are not resident in the United Kingdom, but must previously have been resident here and included in the electoral register (unless they were too young to register). They are registered in the same parliamentary constituency as before they went abroad. Attainer is the term used to describe a person who attains the age of 18 during the currency of the register, and is entitled to vote at an election held on or after his or her eighteenth birthday.</p>","Local Authority","Greater London","Office for National Statistics","","","Annual","2001 to 2009","Feb 2010","29/11/2010","Crown Copyright","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=319","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=319","http://data.london.gov.uk/datafiles/demographics/electoral-roll-numbers-borough.xls","","","","","","","","","attainers, demography, electoral, electors, ons, population, registers, roll, voting","","",""

<p>The Government's Indices of Deprivation are produced for small areas across England. Summary measures of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are published for local authorities. This dataset gives GLA calculations giving, as far as possible, comparable summary measures for wards in London. It also includes GLA calculations giving the two supplementary indices at ward level.</p>\
<p>The purpose is to replicate, as far as possible, the local authority level measures published by CLG and gives alternative and additional measures, including a ward level version of the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) and the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI).

<p>The London Analysts Support site team (LASS) have developed this dataset in consultation with the Ambulance service to make their data more suitable for crime analysis purposes. Please note: The primary purpose of the London Ambulance Service is to save lives and respond effectively to medical emergencies. The data provided here is an extract of ambulance data, which is recorded to monitor their performance to this end.</p>\
<p>The LASS team work with the ambulance service to extract data suitable for crime analysis professionals, with the aim of causing minimum disruption to frontline services. These incidents of assault injury have been identified through a fairly sophisticated search through various codes and descriptions of incidents that occur in the process of responding to a 999 call. This has been done in close consultation with the ambulance service to ensure that the data is fit for crime analysis purposes.</p>\
<p>It should be considered that the precision of the crime related information, in the above said process, is of secondary consideration to the need to record accurate medical information, therefore the accuracy of the data may have minor variations over time and in different areas of London. LASS work closely with the London Ambulance Service to ensure that there is no significant impact on the quality of information for crime related purposes.</p>\
<p>This specific data set has seen improved reporting over the last two years. Therefore the trends revealed in the 'violent patient' dataset may be more related to increased reporting rather than a real behavioural trend in London. Crime analysts use this data to scan for issues, patterns and trends in violence in London. They compare and contrast with traditional sources of intelligence such as recorded crime data from the police. Recently this data set has been used in the Mayor's meetings with the police to identify violent crime hotspots that were not previously recognised.</p>\

<p>This workbook contains baselines for NI9, 10 and 11 for all upper-tier local authorities. Percentage is weighted. This is the best estimate of adult usage/participation in the local authority, and forms the baseline against which progress will be measured. All survey data contain a margin of error; this is also known as the confidence interval, which is presented as a range around an estimate. For this report the range has been calculated using a 95% confidence interval, which means there is a 95% probability the true percentage lies in the range given. The best estimate available is the mid-point. Assuming a normal distribution, the actual figure is most likely to be around the mid-point but it could be at either end of the range.</p>\
<p>A number of factors will affect the level of change required in order for the survey to register a statistically significant change. One of these is the number of interviews conducted – the greater the size the more sensitive it is to detecting change. Another factor is the baseline percentage, with those nearer to 50 per cent requiring more change to occur. The ‘minimum detectable change’ takes these factors into account to indicate the minimum percentage point change required between the baseline estimate and the final estimate to record a statistically significant&nbsp; increase in usage/participation. This calculation assumes that the number of interviews conducted in the assessment year is not less than in the baseline year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Libaries (used for NI9) measures the percentage of adults in a LA who have used a public library service in the past 12 months. Use is for leisure purposes, including informal learning and studying or research for personal interests.</p>\
<p>Museums and Galleries (used for NI10) measures the percentage of adults in a LA who have visited a museum or gallery in the past 12 months. Visits are for leisure purposes, including informal learning and studying or research for personal interests. Online access to collections and outreach services are not counted.<br /><br />Arts (used for NI11) measures the percentage of adults in a LA who have either attended an arts event or participated in an arts activity at least three times in the past 12 months.

<p>The Excess Winter Mortality Index (EWM Index was calculated based on the 'ONS Method' which defines the winter period as December to March, and the non-winter period as August to November of that same year and April to July of the following year.</p>\
<p>This winter period was selected as they are the months which over the last 50 years have displayed above average monthly mortality. However, if mortality starts to increase prior to this, for example in November, the number of deaths in the non-winter period will increase, which in turn will decrease the estimate of excess winter mortality.</p>\
<p>The EWM Index will be partly dependent on the proportion of older people in the population as most excess winter deaths effect older people (there is no standardisation in this calculation by age or any other factor).</p>\
<p>Excess winter mortality is calculated as winter deaths (deaths occurring in December to March) minus the average of non-winter deaths (April to July of the current year and August to November of the previous year).

The data is created by a large community of volunteers who use a variety of simple on-the-ground surveying techniques, and wiki-syle editing tools to collaborate as they create the maps, in a process which is open to everyone. The project originated in London, and an active community of mappers and developers are based here. Mapping work in London is ongoing (and you can help!) but the coverage is already good enough for many uses.</p>\

<h3>Data access APIs:</h3>\
<p>Download small areas of the map by bounding-box. For example this URL requests the data around Trafalgar Square:<br /> <a title=""OSM API query: data around Trafalgar Square"" href=""http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-0.13062,51.5065,-0.12557,51.50969"">http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-0.13062,51.5065,-0.12557,51.50969</a></p>\

<h3>The .osm format</h3>\
<p>The format of the data is a raw XML represention of all the elements making up the map. OpenStreetMap is composed of interconnected ""nodes"" and ""ways"" (and sometimes ""relations"") each with a set of name=value pairs called ""tags"". These classify and describe properties of the elements, and ultimately influence how they get drawn on the map. To understand more about tags, and different ways of working with this data format refer to the following pages on the OpenStreetMap wiki.</p>\

<h3>Simple embedded maps</h3>\
<p>Rather than working with raw map data, you may prefer to embed maps from OpenStreetMap on your website with a simple bit of javascript. You can also present overlays of other data, in a manner very similar to working with google maps. In fact you can even use the google maps API to do this. See <a href=""http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_on_your_own_website"">OSM on your own website</a> for details and links to various javascript map libraries.</p>\
<h3>Help build the map!</h3>\
<p>The OpenStreetMap project aims to attract large numbers of contributors who all chip in a little bit to help build the map. Although the map editing tools take a little while to learn, they are designed to be as simple as possible, so that everyone can get involved. This project offers an exciting means of allowing local London communities to take ownership of their part of the map.</p>\

The long-term rate (IBLT) applies to people who have been sick for more than a year. The higher short-term rate and the long-term rate are treated as taxable income. For the first 28 weeks of incapacity, people previously in work are assessed on the ‘own occupation’ test, i.e. the claimant’s ability to do their own job. Otherwise incapacity is based on the ‘personal capability assessment’ (formerly ‘all work test’), which assesses ability to carry out a range of work-related activities. The test applies after 28 weeks of incapacity or from the start of the claim for people who did not previously have a job. Certain people are exempt from the personal capability assessment. These include, those in receipt of the Disability Living Allowance care component at the higher rate, those registered blind, and those suffering from a severe illness (for example tetraplegia, persistent vegetative state, dementia).</p>\

It is not necessary to have paid National Insurance contributions to be eligible. Pension Credit replaced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), which, itself, replaced Income Support for older people in April 1999. However, the principle of a guaranteed minimum income continues to apply.</p>\
<p>There are two parts to Pension Credit: the guarantee credit and the savings credit. The guarantee credit provides financial help for people aged 60 or over whose income is below a certain level set by the law. The level that applies depends on personal circumstances; this is the standard minimum guarantee. The awarded amount will depend on other sources of income, such as other pensions and savings. Extra amounts will be added to the standard minimum guarantee for those who have: relevant housing costs severe disabilities caring responsibilities</p>\
<p>The savings credit is an extra amount for people aged 65 or over who have made some provision for their retirement (such as savings or a second pension) which brings their income above a level set by Parliament, called the ‘savings credit threshold’. The aim is to reward pensioners who have modest income or savings. A savings credit can be given on top of a guarantee credit.

<p>SMR measures whether the population of an area has a higher or lower number of deaths than expected based on the age profile of the population (more deaths are expected in older populations). The SMR is defined as follows: SMR = (Observed no. of deaths per year)/(Expected no. of deaths per year<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;""><span style=""line-height: 19px;"">).</span></span></p>\
<p>SMRs are calculated using the previous year's mid-year population estimates. 2009 live births are used for calculations involving deaths under 1 year.</p>\
<p>The age-standardised mortality rates in this release are directly  age-standardised to the European Standard Population, which cover all  ages and allows comparisons between populations with different age  structures, including between males and females and over time.  Age-standardised rates for 2009 in this release are provisional as they  were calculated using the 2008-based population projections for 2009.

<p>PTALS are a detailed and accurate measure of the accessibility of a point to the public transport network, taking into account walk access time and service availability. The method is essentially a way of measuring the density of the public transport network at any location within Greater London.</p>\
<p>The current methodology was developed in 1992, by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The model has been thoroughly reviewed and tested, and has been agreed by the London Borough-led PTAL development group as the most appropriate for use across London.</p>\
<p>The measure therefore reflects:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>• Walking time from the point-of interest to the public transport access points;</li>\
<li>• The reliability of the service modes available;</li>\
<li>• The number of services available within the catchment; and</li>\
<li>• The level of service at the public transport access points - i.e. average waiting time.</li>\
</ul>\
<p>It does not consider:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>• The speed or utility of accessible services;</li>\
<li>• Crowding, including the ability to board services; or,</li>\
<li>• Ease of interchange.</li>\
</ul>\
<p>The PTAL methodology was developed for London where a dense integrated public transport network means that nearly all destinations can be reached within a reasonable amount of time. Research using the ATOS (Access to Opportunities and Services) methodology shows that there is a strong correlation between PTALs and the time taken to reach key services – i.e. high PTAL areas generally have good access to services and low PTAL areas have poor access to services.</p>\

However, no information is available where a Housing Association maintains a separate waiting list to the local authority. Direct comparisons between authorities' housing waiting lists can be misleading in particular because authorities have different arrangements for checking that applicants continue to require housing and their policies and practices can change over time.<br /><br />The introduction of choice-based approaches to the letting of social housing (whereby applicants have more of a say and choice over where they live) has had an impact on the size of the waiting list. Choice-based lettings (CBL) has led to increases in the number of households on the waiting lists, including those groups which are traditionally under-represented in social housing, e.g. people in employment. The accuracy of the list also depends on the extent to which housing authorities keep the register up-to-date, e.g. some people might already have found housing, yet remain on the list. The introduction of CBL and the removal of the statutory duty to maintain a register have taken away much of the rationale for regularly reviewing the waiting list.<br /><br />However, it was anticipated that housing authorities would continue to maintain a waiting list of housing applicants in order to perform their allocation function properly.<br />The districts, unitary authorities and counties listed above are based on 1 April 1998 boundaries. Figures for any ""new"" re-organised areas have been estimated retrospectively applying the new boundaries back to 1996, making appropriate assumptions for any county re-organisation which involved cutting across districts.<br /><br />Some earlier years' data might have changed based on updated figures in later years' returns.<br /><br />Latest available mid-year household estimates for the districts used.<br /><br />Data for each year are from the year&nbsp; in which they were reported.

Flag 4s are codes within the PRDS system which indicate that someone who has registered with a GP in England and Wales was previously living overseas.</p>\
<p>All the Flag 4 data are unrounded. <br />These data are designated as ‘Official statistics not designated as National Statistics’. These data must be sourced to the Office for National Statistics.<br />Flag 4 statistics provide an indication of recent international in-migrants to local authority areas; however due to the definitional differences the figures are not directly comparable to other indicators of migration such as estimates of long-term international migration.<br />Flag 4 statistics are derived from an administrative system which is not designed primarily for statistical purposes. For more information on using administrative data sources please see ‘A Review of the Potential Use of Administrative Sources in the Estimation of Population Statistics’: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/specific/population/future/imps/updates/downloads/admin.pdf</p>\
<p>Flag 4 records may not be retained on patient register records through the person's subsequent migration within UK. The patient register is a 'snapshot' taken annually.&nbsp; When an in-migrant subsequently moves internally within the UK and re-registers with a second GP, the Flag 4 demarcation is not retained as the individual’s last residence is now within the UK. If this internal migration occurs within the year of in-migration, i.e. before the next mid-year snapshot, the in-migration will not be recorded.GP registration is not compulsory. Some migrants will only register with a GP if, and when, they require medical attention. There may also be a lag between the migration event and the eventual GP registration.The completeness of the data depends on all patients registering with an NHS GP when they move to the England and Wales. However, it is known that registration patterns vary by sex and age group. Therefore, the usefulness of the data as an indicator of migration is limited by some groups being less likely to register with a GP than others. For example, young men (who make up a large proportion of migrants) are less likely to register with a GP than other groups.</p>\

The average population of an LSOA in London in 2010 was 1,642 compared with 7,961 for an MSOA and 12,640 for a ward.</p>\
<p>The profiles are designed to provide an overview of the population in these small areas by combining a range of data on the population, diversity, households, health, housing, crime, benefits, land use, deprivation, schools, and employment.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>This <a href=""http://data.london.gov.uk/visualisations/lsoa-atlas-analysis.pdf"">table</a> shows some of the most interesting indicators and displays the areas that are ranked top and bottom for each one. For example,</p>\
<p>* LSOAs in Greenwich had the biggest population increase and population decrease.</p>\
<ul>\
</ul>\
<p>* Population density ranges from 1 person per hectare to 821.</p>\
<p>* In the LSOA in Greenwich that had the biggest population decrease, there was also the lowest number of crimes (17).</p>\
<p>* The LSOA with the highest population density had the lowest consumption of power</p>\
<p>* In an LSOA in Hackney over half of families have 3 or more children</p>\
<p>* In an LSOA in Tower Hamlets 65% of children are in out of work families and 71% of children are living in 'poverty'.</p>\
<ul>\
</ul>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>If you need to find an LSOA and you know the postcode of the area, the <a href=""http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/"" target=""_blank"">ONS NESS search</a> page has a tool for this.</p>\
<p>The LSOA Atlas is presented using InstantAtlas mapping software. This is a useful tool for displaying a large amount of data for numerous geographies, in one place &nbsp;(requires&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/"" target=""_blank"">Adobe Flash Player</a>).</p>\

<p>NB. It is currently not possible to&nbsp;export the map as a picture due to a software issue with the Google Maps background. We advise you to print screen to copy an image to the clipboard.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>IMPORTANT: Due to the large amount of data and areas, the LSOA Atlas may take up to a minute to fully load. Once loaded, the report will work more efficiently by using the filter tool and selecting one borough at a time. Displaying every LSOA in London will slow down the data reload.</p>\
<p>Tips:</p>\
<ol>\
<li>- Select a new indicator from the Data box on the left. Select the theme, then indicator and then year to show the data.</li>\
<li>\
<div>- To view data just for one borough, use the filter tool.&nbsp;</div>\
</li>\
<li>\
<div>- The legend settings can be altered by clicking on the pencil icon next to the LSOA tick box within the map legend.</div>\
